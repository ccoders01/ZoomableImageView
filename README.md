# ZoomableImageView

ZoomableImageView is a view designed to add pinch-to-zoom support for images in Android with minimal effort. 

## Usage

Include ZoomableImageView.java and OnImageTouchedListener in your project, add the view either programatically or via XML to your activity and call:

	zoomableImageView.setImageBitmap( bitmap );

## Demo

A working demo of the class in use can be seen in the app [Reddit Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync). Clicking on a thumbnail will open up a fullscreen ZoomableImageView.
